    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="muted">Effective date: <strong>October 8, 2025</strong></p>

    <p>This Privacy Policy explains how Blossom &amp; Blade (“<strong>we</strong>,” “<strong>us</strong>,” or “<strong>our</strong>”) collects, uses, and shares information when you use our website and AI chat services (the “<strong>Service</strong>”).</p>

    <h2>1) Information we collect</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Account &amp; contact.</strong> Email address and basic account details you provide (e.g., for receipts, support, or login links).</li>
      <li><strong>Payment.</strong> Our payment processor collects payment details (e.g., card). We receive limited information (e.g., payment status) but not full card numbers.</li>
      <li><strong>Usage &amp; device.</strong> IP address, device/browser details, timestamps, and basic analytics (page views, clicks). We use cookies/local storage for features like the 18+ gate and session continuity.</li>
      <li><strong>Chat content.</strong> Your prompts and the AI responses. For the Monthly plan, we keep conversation “memory” to personalize your experience.</li>
      <li><strong>Safety signals.</strong> Automated flags and limited human review for policy enforcement, fraud prevention, and safety (e.g., self-harm indicators).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2) How we use information</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Provide and maintain the Service (including chat generation and “memory”).</li>
      <li>Process payments and manage subscriptions.</li>
      <li>Operate safety systems, detect abuse, and enforce our House Rules.</li>
      <li>Communicate with you (support, receipts, important updates).</li>
      <li>Improve the Service using de-identified or aggregated data.</li>
      <li>Comply with law, legal process, and to protect our rights and users.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3) Data retention</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Day Pass:</strong> we generally retain chat content for up to <strong>30 days</strong> for fraud prevention and safety review, then delete or de-identify it.</li>
      <li><strong>Monthly:</strong> we retain chat “memory” while your subscription is active and may delete or archive it within <strong>30–60 days</strong> after lapse. If you re-subscribe after memory is deleted, we treat you as new.</li>
      <li><strong>Safety logs:</strong> for policy enforcement, we may retain up to the last <strong>five (5)</strong> flagged transcripts and related records for up to <strong>12 months</strong> (or longer if needed for legal reasons).</li>
      <li><strong>Legal/backup copies:</strong> we may keep minimal archival copies as required by law or for security/backup.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4) Sharing</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Vendors.</strong> We use trusted service providers (e.g., hosting, payment processing, email). They process data on our instructions.</li>
      <li><strong>Safety &amp; legal.</strong> We may disclose information if we believe it’s necessary to comply with law, prevent fraud, protect rights/safety, or respond to lawful requests.</li>
      <li><strong>Business transfers.</strong> If we undergo a merger, acquisition, or asset sale, information may transfer as part of that transaction.</li>
      <li><strong>No sale of personal data.</strong> We do not sell your personal information.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5) Security</h2>
    <p>We use reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect information. No system is 100% secure. You are responsible for safeguarding your account and device.</p>

    <h2>6) Your choices &amp; rights</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Access &amp; deletion.</strong> You can request a copy or deletion of your account data by emailing <a href="mailto:blossomnblade1@gmail.com">blossomnblade1@gmail.com</a>. We may ask to verify your identity and may retain information as required by law or for safety logs.</li>
      <li><strong>Marketing.</strong> If we send marketing emails, you can opt out via the email footer.</li>
      <li><strong>Cookies.</strong> You can control cookies in your browser; some features may not work without necessary cookies.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>7) Children</h2>
    <p>The Service is for adults only (18+). We do not knowingly collect data from children. If you believe a minor is using the Service, contact us and we will take appropriate action.</p>

    <h2>8) International users</h2>
    <p>We are US-based. If you use the Service from outside the US, your information may be transferred to and processed in the US or other countries with different data-protection laws.</p>

    <h2>9) Changes</h2>
    <p>We may update this Policy. If we make material changes, we’ll post the new effective date and, where required, provide notice. Your continued use means you accept the changes.</p>
