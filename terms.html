    <h1>Terms of Use</h1>
    <p class="muted">Effective date: <strong>October 8, 2025</strong></p>

    <p>These Terms of Use (“<strong>Terms</strong>”) govern your access to and use of the Blossom N Blade website and services (the “<strong>Service</strong>”). By using the Service you agree to these Terms.</p>

    <h2>1) What we are</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>AI-only, fantasy-forward.</strong> All chats are generated by AI characters. No human-to-human dating or human operators.</li>
      <li><strong>Adults only (18+).</strong> You must be at least 18 (or older where required). We gate with an adults-only check and may revoke access if we believe you are underage.</li>
      <li><strong>Entertainment, not advice.</strong> We don’t provide medical, psychological, legal, or financial advice. In an emergency call 911 (US) or your local emergency number. Crisis help: 988 (US).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2) Accounts, access, and “memory”</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Trial.</strong> Promotional/free trials may change or end anytime and have no cash value.</li>
      <li><strong>Day Pass (24 hours).</strong> Access to one character for 24 hours from purchase. No auto-renew.</li>
      <li><strong>Monthly.</strong> Access to all characters. Auto-renews monthly unless canceled. “Memory” (conversation history) persists while your subscription is active; if your subscription lapses, memory resets as described in the Privacy Policy.</li>
      <li><strong>Eligibility/region.</strong> You are responsible for laws in your location and for securing your device/account.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3) House Rules (allowed vs. banned)</h2>
    <p><em>Allowed:</em> consensual adult fantasies; adult “Daddy/Mommy” roleplay (explicitly adult); possessive/jealous boyfriend vibes; rough talk; kink negotiation.</p>
    <p><em>Banned (hard NO):</em> minors or implied minors; bestiality; non-consensual harm; sex trafficking; domestic-violence play; scat; necrophilia; doxxing/real-world threats; illegal activity.</p>
    <p>We may temporarily or permanently suspend or ban accounts for violations. See Safety &amp; Enforcement below.</p>

    <h2>4) Payments, renewal, and refunds</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Processor.</strong> Payments are handled by a third-party processor. We do not store full card numbers.</li>
      <li><strong>Pricing &amp; taxes.</strong> Prices may change. Taxes/fees may apply.</li>
      <li><strong>Auto-renew (Monthly).</strong> Monthly renews until you cancel. Cancel anytime to stop the next cycle; no partial refunds for unused time.</li>
      <li><strong>Refund policy.</strong> <u>Purchases are non-refundable after 24 hours.</u> Within 24 hours, refunds are available only for verified technical access failures (e.g., you could not access the Service due to our fault). Abuse of chargebacks may result in suspension.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5) Safety &amp; enforcement</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Automated &amp; human review.</strong> The Service may run automated safety checks. Limited human review may occur for safety, fraud, or legal compliance.</li>
      <li><strong>Escalation.</strong> Conversations that indicate imminent self-harm may trigger safety messaging and internal alerts. We’re not a crisis service.</li>
      <li><strong>Strikes &amp; bans.</strong> Repeated or serious violations can result in temporary or permanent bans. We may maintain internal logs of flagged content to defend enforcement actions and prevent repeat abuse.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6) Your content &amp; license</h2>
    <p>You retain rights in the content you input. You grant us a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free license to use, host, reproduce, and process your content solely to operate, maintain, secure, and improve the Service (including safety systems), and to provide features like “memory” in the Monthly plan. See Privacy Policy for retention and deletion.</p>

    <h2>7) Intellectual property</h2>
    <p>The Service, artwork, images, code, and branding are owned by us or our licensors and are protected by law. You may not copy, modify, reverse-engineer, or resell the Service.</p>

    <h2>8) Acceptable use</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>No minors, non-consensual acts, trafficking, domestic-violence play, bestiality, scat, or necrophilia.</li>
      <li>No illegal activity, malware, scraping, or attempts to bypass safety filters.</li>
      <li>No doxxing, credible threats, or harassment.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>9) Disclaimers</h2>
    <p>THE SERVICE IS PROVIDED “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE.” TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, WE DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. WE DO NOT GUARANTEE AVAILABILITY, ACCURACY, OR THAT THE SERVICE WILL MEET YOUR EXPECTATIONS.</p>

    <h2>10) Limitation of liability</h2>
    <p>TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, WE WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, OR ANY LOSS OF PROFITS, DATA, OR GOODWILL. OUR TOTAL LIABILITY FOR ANY CLAIMS RELATING TO THE SERVICE WILL NOT EXCEED THE GREATER OF (A) THE AMOUNT YOU PAID US IN THE <u>THREE (3) MONTHS</u> BEFORE THE CLAIM AROSE OR (B) <u>$100</u>.</p>

    <h2>11) Indemnity</h2>
    <p>You agree to indemnify and hold us harmless from claims, damages, and costs (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) arising out of your misuse of the Service or violation of these Terms.</p>

    <h2>12) Termination</h2>
    <p>You may stop using the Service at any time. We may suspend or terminate access for violations or risk. Upon termination, your license ends and you must stop using the Service. Sections that by nature should survive (e.g., payments due, IP, disclaimers, limits, governing law) will survive.</p>

    <h2>13) Changes</h2>
    <p>We may update these Terms. If we make material changes, we’ll post the new effective date and, where required, provide notice. Continued use means you accept the changes.</p>

    <h2>14) Governing law &amp; venue</h2>
    <p>These Terms are governed by the laws of the State of <strong>Texas</strong>, without regard to conflicts rules. Exclusive venue lies in state or federal courts located in <strong>Montgomery County, Texas</strong>. You and we waive any objection to such courts’ jurisdiction and venue.</p>
